This difference is called the Balance Factor.\nThe height of an AVL tree is always O(Logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.</p>\n<p>AVL Tree Rotations:-</p>\n<p>In AVL tree, after performing every operation like insertion and deletion we need to check the balance factor of every node in the tree. If every node satisfies the balance factor condition then we conclude the operation otherwise we must make it balanced. We use rotation operations to make the tree balanced whenever the tree is becoming imbalanced due to any operation.</p>\n<p>Rotation operations are used to make a tree balanced.There are four rotations and they are classified into two types:\n->Single Left Rotation (LL Rotation)\nIn LL Rotation every node moves one position to left from the current position.\n->Single Right Rotation (RR Rotation)\nIn RR Rotation every node moves one position to right from the current position.\n->Left Right Rotation (LR Rotation)\nThe LR Rotation is combination of single left rotation followed by single right rotation. In LR Roration, first every node moves one position to left then one position to right from the current position.\n->Right Left Rotation (RL Rotation)\nThe RL Rotation is combination of single right rotation followed by single left rotation. In RL Roration, first every node moves one position to right then one position to left from the current position.</p>',fields:{slug:"/algorithms/avl-trees/"},frontmatter:{title:"AVL Trees"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/algorithms/avl-trees/"}}}});
