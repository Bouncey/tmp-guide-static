It starts with 1, followed by\nanother 1, then a 2, then a 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. Each new number is the sum of the previous two numbers.</p>\n<p>So let’s take it from the start, and it starts with 1. The next number will be the sum of the\nprevious two numbers, which will be 1. Therefore the next number will also be 1.\nThen comes the third number, which will be the sum of 1 and 1, which is 2.\nThen comes 1 and 2, which is 3, 2 and 3, which is 5, 3 and 5, which is 8, and so on.</p>\n<p>This sequence is seen in many places in nature, like the shell of a snail or the\nspiral patterns of a sunflower.</p>\n<p>The initial values are</p>\n<p>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233…</p>\n<p>If you desire to make a program which finds the fibonacci-number after x iterations, make sure you\nhave a large enough boundary. The value grows exponentially quick, and will therefore take more\nspace than expected. </p>\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://oeis.org/A000045">The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences: Fibonacci numbers</a></li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/fibonacci-sequence/"},frontmatter:{title:"Fibonacci Sequence"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/fibonacci-sequence/"}}}});
