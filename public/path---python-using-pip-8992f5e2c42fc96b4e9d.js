Python itself comes with several built-in modules, but the python community has more to offer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Its the modules that makes python so powerful!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Third party modules add so much more functionality to Python. Now we would learn how to install these modules so that we can use those in our programs.</p>\n<p>The simplest way is to use <code>pip</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>pip install <module_name></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you have used <code>npm</code>, then you can think of it as <em>npm</em> of python.</p>\n<p>Last time, in <a><code>import-statements</code></a> wiki we used <code>requests</code> module as an example. As it is a third party module we have to install it separately after installing python.</p>\n<p>Installing it would be as simple as <code>pip install requests</code> . You can even pass various arguments along with it. The one that you’ll come across more often is <code>--upgrade</code>. You can upgrade a python module by :</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>pip install <module_name> --upgrade</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>For example, to upgrade the requests module to its latest version would be as simple as <code>pip install requests --upgrade</code>.</p>\n<p>Before using <code>pip</code>, you will need to install it (it’s quite simple). You can install it from <a href='https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a></p>\n<p>Just click on the link. And save the file as<code>get-pip.py</code> <em>Please don’t forget the <code>.py</code> extension.</em> And run it.</p>\n<p>An alternative to using pip would be to try <a href='https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'><code>easy_install</code></a>.</p>\n<p>Using <code>easy_install</code> is also simple. The syntax is:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>easy_install <module_name></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>However, <code>pip</code> is more popular than using <code>easy_install</code>.</p>",fields:{slug:"/python/using-pip/"},frontmatter:{title:"Python Using Pip"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/python/using-pip/"}}}});
