I was looking around at some solutions on Stack Overflow for trying to ascertain whether an element was visible, and I wasn’t satisfied by the answers I received.</p>\n<p>One answer was to use the jQuery library, and then check to see if the element has the pseudoclass of <code>:visible</code> by using this format: <code>$(element).is(\':visible\')</code>. This works for elements that are hidden by using <code>display: none;</code> on them, but it does not work on any element that has its <code>visibility</code> set to <code>hidden</code>. It also does not work if the parent element is the only element that is hidden from view. If any parent element of the element tested is hidden, using either <code>visibility</code> or <code>display</code>, the element being tested will come back as visible, despite it not being visible on the screen.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>I came up with a pure JavaScript function which solves this problem that has no dependancies and is a cross browser compliant solution. This function will analyze the element first to see if either its <code>display</code> or <code>visibility</code> properties are being shown as <code>none</code> or <code>hidden</code> respectively. Then, if those come back normal, it checks all parent elements up to the body of the document. If a parent element of the element being tested is hidden, that means that the element being tested is not visible in the document.</p>\n<p><a href=\'http://codepen.io/marcusparsons/pen/bpNqgY\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>Here is a sample CodePen that demonstrates this behavior and even shows the comparison being use the jQuery solution and my pure JavaScript solution</a>. Notice in the CodePen that even though the element is cleary hidden from view, using jQuery’s <code>.is(\':visible\')</code> is not a viable option for truly checking any element for visibility.</p>\n<p>And here is the function I created:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>function isVisible (element) {\n    //start with initial element to check visibility and display\n    var el = document.querySelector(element);\n    //display and visibility vary per browser and must be sought in different ways depending on the browser\n    var t1 = el.currentStyle ? el.currentStyle.visibility : getComputedStyle(el, null).visibility;\n    var t2 = el.currentStyle ? el.currentStyle.display : getComputedStyle(el, null).display;\n    //if either of these are true, then the element is not visible\n    if (t1 === "hidden" || t2 === "none") {\n        return false;\n    }\n    //This regex is used to scan the parent nodes all the way up to the body element\n    while (!(/body/i).test(el)) {\n        //get the next parent node\n        el = el.parentNode;\n        //grab the values, if available, \n        t1 = el.currentStyle ? el.currentStyle.visibility : getComputedStyle(el, null).visibility;\n        t2 = el.currentStyle ? el.currentStyle.display : getComputedStyle(el, null).display;\n        if (t1 === "hidden" || t2 === "none") {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    //if all scans are not successful, then the element is visible\n    return true;\n}</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>And to use the function, you only need to call it with a query string to select the element to test i.e.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code><body>\n\t<p style="visibility: hidden;" id="myP">My paragraph</p>\n    <script type="text/javascript">\n    \t//include isVisible function\n    \talert(\'Is my paragraph visible? \' + isVisible(\'#myP\'));\n    </script>\n</body></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>And the resulting alert will be: <code>Is my paragraph visible? false</code></p>',fields:{slug:"/miscellaneous/checking-for-hidden-elements/"},frontmatter:{title:"Checking for Hidden Elements"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/miscellaneous/checking-for-hidden-elements/"}}}});
