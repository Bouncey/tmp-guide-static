For example <code>f(x) = x*2.</code> Any given input from some set (called the domain) always gives one specific output from the range. In the doubling function the inputs 1,3,and 5 map to the numbers 2,6, and 10 in the range, which is also the set of all real numbers.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a “function” in programming (more accurately called a method or subroutine in some languages) is a method that takes one or more values and outputs one or more outputs. There is generally no guarantee that some internal state (such as a global variable) could change in such a way that f(2) could be 5 at one time, or 10 when you run it again. In most languages that is permitted, even expected in some cases, but some languages using <em>functional programming</em> define functions as functions mathematically in that there are no state variables that can change and have inconsistencies, thereby giving more “provably correct” code.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p>Functional languages: <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/what-is-a-function/"},frontmatter:{title:"What Is a Function"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/what-is-a-function/"}}}});
