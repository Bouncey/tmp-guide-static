It is named after the Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, and it can be identified with the following symbol, ℇ. This number has many important uses and roles in mathematics and is applied in calculating compound interest, for example. You would use Euler’s Number in calculus in order to be able to perform differential and integral calculus with exponential functions and logarithms.</p>\n<p><img src="https://github.com/TomerPacific/fccGuideImages/blob/master/Leonhard_Euler.jpg?raw=true" alt="Leonhard_Euler Image"></p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<p> To read more about Euler’s Number, you can go here : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E<em>(mathematical</em>constant</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/e-eulers-number/"},frontmatter:{title:"E Eulers Number"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/e-eulers-number/"}}}});
