If a font has RGB color (255,0,0) this means it has 100% red, and 0% green and blue light. It’s brightness is 255 + 0 + 0 = 255.\nMaximum brightness is white with 255 + 255 + 255 = 765.</p>\n<p><strong>contrast</strong> To determine contrast for the guidelines, subtract the <em>brightness</em> between two colors.</p>\n<h3>Guidelines</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid exceeding paper-level contrasts in text.  Differ brightness between text and text background at least 300 if not 400 —a little more for small fonts, less for larger fonts.\nIf the font color is Red, the RGB value might be (255,0,0) is a brightness of 255 out of 765.\nIf the background is yellow, the RGB value might be (255,255,0) = 510.\nThe difference between 510 and 255 is 255.\nThis example contrast is too low, and brings us to the next guideline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For purposes of checking contrast and adapting color blindness, assume red and green primary colors are the same color.\nThe most common form of color blindness sees red and green similarly.\nThis means for effectiveness with important communication, consider that the colors Red RGB(255,0,0), Green RGB(0,255,0) and “Olive”[1] RGB(127,127,0) are essentially the same color with the same contrast.\nFor calculating contrast, yellow RGB(255,255,0) has double the brightness of any one primary color.\nThe two primary colors still produce twice the brightness of one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>The good news is that there is still lots of flexibility available in choosing an effective color pallet that is palatable to readers.</p>\n<p><a href=\'https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides/blob/master/README.md\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>This quick style guide will help ensure your pull request gets accepted</a>.</p>\n<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
