The types of data that information can be stored as are called data types. C is much less forgiving about data types than other languages. As a result, it’s important to make sure that you understand the existing data types, their abilities, and their limitations.</p>\n<p>One quirk of C’s data types is that they depend entirely on the hardware that you’re running your code on. An <code>int</code> on your laptop will be smaller than an <code>int</code> on a supercomputer, so knowing the limitations of the hardware you’re working on is important. This is also why the data types are defined as being minimums- an <code>int</code> value, as you will learn, is at minimum -32767 to 32767: on certain machines, it will be able to store even more values that this.</p>\n<p>There are two categories that we can break this into: integers, and floating point numbers. Integers are whole numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero. Numbers like -321, 497, 19345, and -976812 are all perfectly valid integers, but 4.5 is not because 4.5 is not a whole number.</p>\n<p>Floating point numbers are numbers with a decimal. Like integers, -321, 497, 19345, and -976812 are all valid, but now 4.5, 0.0004, -324.984, and other non-whole numbers are valid too.</p>\n<p>C allows us to choose between several different options with our data types because they are all stored in different ways on the computer. As a result, it is important to be aware of the abilities and limitations of each data type to choose the right one.</p>\n<h2>Integer data types</h2>\n<h4>Characters: <code>char</code></h4>\n<p><code>char</code> holds characters- things like letters, punctuation, and spaces. In a computer, characters are stored as numbers, so <code>char</code> holds integer values that represent characters. The actual translation is described by the ASCII standard. <a href='http://www.asciitable.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Here’s</a> a handy table for looking up that.</p>\n<p>The actual size, like all other data types in C, depends on the hardware you’re working on. By minimum, it is at least 8 bits, so you will have at least 0 to 127. Alternatively, you can use <code>signed char</code> to get at least -128 to 127.</p>\n<h4>Standard Integers: <code>int</code></h4>\n<p>The amount of memory that a single <code>int</code> takes depends on the hardware. However, you can expect an <code>int</code> to be at least 16 bits in size. This means that it can store values from -32,768 to 32,767, or more depending on hardware.</p>\n<p>Like all of these other data types, there is an <code>unsigned</code> variant that can be used. The <code>unsigned int</code> can be positive and zero but not negative, so it can store values from 0 to 65,535, or more depending on hardware.</p>\n<h4>Short integers: <code>short</code></h4>\n<p>This doesn’t get used often, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like int, it can store -32768 to 32767. Unlike int, however, this is the extent of its ability. Anywhere you can use <code>short</code>, you can use <code>int</code>.</p>\n<h4>Longer integers: <code>long</code></h4>\n<p>The <code>long</code> data type stores integers like <code>int</code>, but gives a wider range of values at the cost of taking more memory. Long stores at least 32 bits, giving it a range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Alternatively, use <code>unsigned long</code> for a range of 0 to 4,294,967,295.</p>\n<h4>Even longer integers: <code>long long</code></h4>\n<p>The <code>long long</code> data type is overkill for just about every application, but C will let you use it anyway. It’s capable of storing at least −9,223,372,036,854,775,807 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Alternatively, get even more overkill with <code>unsigned long long</code>, which will give you at least 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.</p>\n<h2>Floating point number data types</h2>\n<h4>Basic Floating point numbers: <code>float</code></h4>\n<p><code>float</code> takes at least 32 bits to store, but gives us 6 decimal places from 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38.</p>\n<h4>Doubles: <code>double</code></h4>\n<p><code>double</code> takes double the memory of float (so at least 64 bits). In return, double can provide 15 decimal place from 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308.</p>\n<h4>Getting a wider range of doubles: <code>long double</code></h4>\n<p><code>long double</code> takes at least 80 bits. As a result, we can get 19 decimal places from 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932.</p>\n<h2>Picking the right data type</h2>\n<p>C makes pick the data type, and makes us be very specific and intentional about the way that we do this. This gives you a lot of power over your code, but it’s important to pick the right one.</p>\n<p>In general, you should pick the minimum for your task. If you know you’ll be counting from 1 to 10, you don’t need a long and you don’t need a double. If you know that you will never have negative values, look into using the <code>unsigned</code> variants of the data types. By providing this functionality rather than doing it automatically, C is able to produce very light and efficient code. However, it’s up to you as the programmer to understand the abilities and limitations, and choose accordingly.</p>\n<h1>Before you go on…</h1>\n<h2>A review</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The actual abilities of C data types depend on the hardware.
