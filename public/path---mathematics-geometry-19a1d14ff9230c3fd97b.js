A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.\nWhile geometry has evolved significantly throughout the years, there are some general concepts that are more or less fundamental to geometry. These include the concepts of points, lines, planes, surfaces, angles, and curves, as well as the more advanced notions of manifolds and topology or metric and they apply to one dimension (a line) 2 dimensions (a plan) 3 or even more. </p>\n<p>Representing figures in geometry allows to use several memmes or theorems like the ones of Pytagoras or Thales</p>",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/geometry/"},frontmatter:{title:"Geometry"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/geometry/"}}}});
