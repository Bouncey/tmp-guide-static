It also helps to identify weak points and opportunities of the process. The main reason for creating such map is to stay focused on the user and not on technical, organisational or other aspects of building the service.</p>\n<h3>More Information On Creating Customer Journey Map:</h3>\n<p><a href="https://uxmastery.com/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map/">How To Create A Customer Journey Map</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/user-experience-research/customer-journey-maps/"},frontmatter:{title:"Customer Journey Maps"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/user-experience-research/customer-journey-maps/"}}}});
