Three separate rendering modes were generally available across browsers. <strong>Full standards mode</strong> renders pages according to the W3C web standards. <strong>Quirks mode</strong> renders pages in a non standards compliant way. <strong>Almost standards mode</strong> is close to full standards mode, but features support for a small number of quirks.</p>\\n<p>In the modern age of HTML5, web standards are fully implemented in all major browsers.
