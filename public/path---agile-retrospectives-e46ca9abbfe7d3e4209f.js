It consists on a board with as many columns as people in the team (you can use something like Trello or just a regular whiteboard) and two more for the things to “discuss” and those to be “mentioned”. Everybody has 10 minutes to fill their column with things from the last sprint they want to highlight (these are represented with cards or Post-it’s). Afterwards, each team member explains each of their own items. Finally, each team member chooses which topics they think should be mentioned or discussed, by moving the card/post-it to the respectively column. The team then decides which topics should be discussed and talk about them for about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Invite the scrum team only to the Retrospective. (Delivery Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master). Discourage managers, stakeholders, business partners, etc. They are a distraction and can hinder the sense of openness the team needs.</p>\n<p>For a co-located team, index cards and post-its work great for this process. For distributed teams, there are a variety of online tools and apps to facilitate the discussion</p>\n<p>Action items should be notated on a board to make tracking progress visual and more distinguishable. Every new retrospective should start with reviewing the status of the action items decided upon during the <em>previous</em> restrospective.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->",fields:{slug:"/agile/retrospectives/"},frontmatter:{title:"Retrospectives"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/retrospectives/"}}}});
