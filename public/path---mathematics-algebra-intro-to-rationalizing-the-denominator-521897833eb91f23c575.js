To simplify the fraction we should rationalize the denominator. Rationalizing the denominator can aid you in solving certain equations. There are a couple ways to do this.</p>\n<h3>Multiplying by a Root</h3>\n<p>We can multiply the top and bottom by a root. Notice that we are multiplying the fraction by root 2 divided by itself which is just another way or writing 1.  </p>\n<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art4img1.png?raw=true">\n<h3>Multiplying by a Conjugate</h3>\n<p>We can also multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate.</p>\n<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art4img2.png?raw=true">\n \n<img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art4img3.png?raw=true">',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/algebra/intro-to-rationalizing-the-denominator/"},frontmatter:{title:"Intro to Rationalizing the Denominator"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/algebra/intro-to-rationalizing-the-denominator/"}}}});
