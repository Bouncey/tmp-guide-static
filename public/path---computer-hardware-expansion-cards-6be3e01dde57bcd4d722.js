For example, the original IBM PC did not have on-board graphics or hard drive capability. In that case, a graphics card and an ST-506 hard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface respectively. Some single-board computers made no provision for expansion cards, and may only have provided IC sockets on the board for limited changes or customization. Since reliable multi-pin connectors are relatively costly, some mass-market systems such as home computers had no expansion slots and instead used a card-edge connector at the edge of the main board, putting the costly matching socket into the cost of the peripheral device.</p>\n<p>In the case of expansion of on-board capability, a motherboard may provide a single serial RS232 port or Ethernet port. An expansion card can be installed to offer multiple RS232 ports or multiple and higher bandwidth Ethernet ports. In this case, the motherboard provides basic functionality but the expansion card offers additional or enhanced ports. The most common expansion card used today is the grapics card. </p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_card' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Expansion Cards</a></li>\n</ul>",fields:{slug:"/computer-hardware/expansion-cards/"},frontmatter:{title:"Expansion Cards"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/computer-hardware/expansion-cards/"}}}});
