For example, a ruler that measures a known length of 1 meter as 1 meter would have high accuracy; a ruler that measures the same distance as 0.8 meter would have low accuracy.</p>\n<p>The precision of a measurement is the repeatibility of that measurement and expresses the variability within it. For example, if the ruler mentioned above that measured 1 meter as 0.8 meter, measured the distance as 0.80 m, 0.79 m, 0.80 m, 0.81 m and 0.80 m over successive mesurements the ruler would be quite precise (the measurements have low variability), whilst being inaccurate.</p>\n<p>The precision of a measurement is independent of the accuracy of the measurement. Likewise the accuracy of a measurement is independent of its precision. This means that measurements can be precise and of low accuracy, accurate and of low precision, precise and accurate, and imprecise and inaccurate.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p><a href="http://www.statisticshowto.com/accuracy-and-precision/">Accuracy and Precision</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/accuracy-and-precision/"},frontmatter:{title:"Accuracy and Precision"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/accuracy-and-precision/"}}}});
