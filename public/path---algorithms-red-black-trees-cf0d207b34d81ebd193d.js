The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree. If we make sure that height of the tree remains O(Logn) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(Logn) for all these operations. The height of a Red Black tree is always O(Logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.</p>\n<p>Comparison with AVL Tree\nThe AVL trees are more balanced compared to Red Black Trees, but they may cause more rotations during insertion and deletion. So if your application involves many frequent insertions and deletions, then Red Black trees should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over Red Black Tree.</p>",fields:{slug:"/algorithms/red-black-trees/"},frontmatter:{title:"Red Black Trees"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/algorithms/red-black-trees/"}}}});
