So generally speaking, the higher code coverage reported by the test suite, the less chance there is of bugs going unnoticed.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that 100% code coverage means 0% chance of bugs, however! Itâ€™s easy to imagine a situation in which all the available functions in a piece of code are called, but not not necessarily with inputs representing all the kinds of scenarios you might expect from real users. </p>\n<p>The ins and outs of how code coverage will not be of much interest until you are actually using automated testing and trying to ensure you are doing it effectively.</p>\n<h4>More information</h4>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">Wikipedia - code coverage</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/test-driven-development">freeCodeCamp Guide - Test Driven Development</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering/unit-tests">freeCodeCamp Guide - Unit Tests</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/continuous-integration">freeCodeCamp Guide - Continuous Integration</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/software-engineering/code-coverage/"},frontmatter:{title:"Code Coverage"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/software-engineering/code-coverage/"}}}});
