Instead, React.js acts as the ‘V’ in MVC (Model View Controller). It is simply a view engine that can be dropped in and used with a plethora of other tools for the data and model part of MVC (most popularly Redux and Node.js).</p>\n<h3>Low learning curve</h3>\n<p>Of the major frontend “frameworks” available, React has a relatively low barrier to entry and has a quick ramp up time.</p>\n<h3>Tooling</h3>\n<p>The tools and software commonly utilized with React are incredibly well maintained and supported and provide several different avenues of best practices to follow when developing web applications. Some of these tools include Redux, React-router, Thunk, and many others.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>React is created and maintained by the folks at Facebook and is used by individuals and companies all over the world in large volume. This means React is constantly improving and any problems you may have have probably already been asked on Stack Overflow.</p>\n<h4>More Information</h4>\n<p>To learn more about why React is so great check out the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">official website</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/react/why-react/"},frontmatter:{title:"Why React"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/react/why-react/"}}}});
