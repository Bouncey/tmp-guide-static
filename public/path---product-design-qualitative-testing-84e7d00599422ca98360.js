The user is given an introduction and may simply be asked to try to use the system.\nDuring this process, the researcher makes note of the user’s explicit responses as well as implicit responses by noticing the tone of response, body language, irritation or delight.</p>\n<h3>Surveys</h3>\n<p>While surveys are generally used to determine statistical information (or it’s relevance), they may contain open-ended questions, which a researcher then analyses to determine user perception.</p>\n<h3>Personal Judgement</h3>\n<p>A domain expert may also give direct qualitative feedback based on their experience e.g. a UI designer may clearly see that the color theme on a website creates cognitive dissonance. This feedback is a very valuable part of Qualitative Testing.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->",fields:{slug:"/product-design/qualitative-testing/"},frontmatter:{title:"Qualitative Testing"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/product-design/qualitative-testing/"}}}});
