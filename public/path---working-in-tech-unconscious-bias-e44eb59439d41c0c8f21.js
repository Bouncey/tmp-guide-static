Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. For that reason the benefits of prejudism can only exist at the expense of others. Therefore to be “biased for” you must be “biased against”.</p>\n<p>Unconscious bias occurs when people favour others who look like them and/or share their values. For example a person may be drawn to someone with a similar educational background, from the same area, or who is the same colour or ethnicity as them.<sup>2<sup></p>\n<p>Implicit or unconscious bias happens by our brains making incredibly quick judgments and assessments of people and situations without us realising. Our biases are influenced by our background, cultural environment and personal experiences. We may not even be aware of these views and opinions, or be aware of their full impact and implications.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>Unconscious bias is far more prevalent than conscious prejudice and often incompatible with one’s conscious values. Certain scenarios can activate unconscious attitudes and beliefs. For example, biases may be more prevalent when multi-tasking or working under time pressure.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<h4>Project Implicit:</h4>\n<p>Project Implicit is a non-profit organization and international collaboration between researchers who are interested in implicit social cognition - thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control. The goal of the organization is to educate the public about hidden biases and to provide a “virtual laboratory” for collecting data on the Internet.</p>\n<p>They have produced <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html">a variety of online tests</a> to examine implicit bias in common situations. </p>\n<p>Unconscious bias can influence decisions in recruitment, promotion and performance management. It could be discriminatory when the unconscious bias relates to a protected characteristic.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias">Navarro, Renee MD. “What is unconscious bias?” <em>University of California, San Francisco.</em> Accessed: October 20, 2017</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5433">“Unconscious Bias.” <em>Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.</em> Accessed: October 20, 2017</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.ecu.ac.uk/guidance-resources/employment-and-careers/staff-recruitment/unconscious-bias/">“Unconscious Bias.” <em>Equality Challenge Unit.</em> Accessed: October 20, 2017</a></li>\n</ol>',fields:{slug:"/working-in-tech/unconscious-bias/"},frontmatter:{title:"Unconscious Bias"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/working-in-tech/unconscious-bias/"}}}});
