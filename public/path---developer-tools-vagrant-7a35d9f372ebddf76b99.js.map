Vagrant supports Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX. You will also need a provider tool. You can choose <a href=\\\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\\\">Virtualbox</a> for an easy start.</p>\\n<p>Next, create a new directory with a name for your box. For instance, <code>mkdir my-vagrant-box</code> will work. Change directories into your new directory, and then make this an active Vagrant folder by running <code>vagrant init hashicorp/precise64</code>. This creates a Vagrant file and hidden .vagrant directory, into which it will download the hachicorp/precise64 box.</p>\\n<p>Once that is done, you will run <code>vagrant up</code> to power on and configure the VM based on your Vagrantfile. When that completes, run <code>vagrant ssh</code> to connect via SSH to your new development machine! You can run any commands that you would normally run on an Ubuntu machine, including exit to leave the session.</p>\\n<p>When you are done, use <code>vagrant destroy</code> to delete this environment. </p>\\n<p>This whole process is explained in more depth on <a href=\\\"https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html\\\">Vagrant’s website</a>.</p>\\n<h4>Vagrant Tips</h4>\\n<p>By default, if you are using a Linux Vagrant box, there will be a directory ‘/vagrant’ that is shared with the directory you created earlier. For instance, if you created the directory ‘my-vagrant-box’, you should be able to add files to it and see them in your ‘/vagrant’ folder when you SSH into your Vagrant box. </p>\",\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/developer-tools/vagrant/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Vagrant\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/developer-tools/vagrant/\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---developer-tools-vagrant-7a35d9f372ebddf76b99.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<h2>Vagrant</h2>\\n<p>Vagrant is a tool to <strong>“Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.”</strong></p>\\n<p>This means Vagrant takes all the headache out of setting up a local development environment.
