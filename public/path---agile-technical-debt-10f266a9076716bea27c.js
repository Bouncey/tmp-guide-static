This is the accumulation of short cuts and work-arounds.</p>\n<p>Compare it to money. When you charge something on a credit card, you’ve made a commitment to pay it back later. When you create technical debt, your team <em>should</em> commit to addressing those issues on a schedule.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of working iteratively is to frequently showcase your increments and gather feedback. If your first pass is “good enough”, and changes are required as a result of that feedback, you may have avoided some unnecessary work. Capture this in your backlog, and include a portion in each sprint to be refactored or improved.</p>\n<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
