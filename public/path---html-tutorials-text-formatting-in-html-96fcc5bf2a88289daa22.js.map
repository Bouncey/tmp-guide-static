It allows to make your text: bold, italic, mark and much more. Changing the style of your text isn’t without any reason - the main thing is just make the reader to take a look for some important notes.</p>\\n<h3>Bold and Strong</h3>\\n<p>You can easily change your text meaning by using HTML <code>&#x3C;b></code> element. It makes words bold, which function is singling out the fragment of sequence. For example: </p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>The most important part of your code is <b>the end</b>, because if you <b>don't close</b> the element, it will affect to <b>everything</b>!</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can also use <code>&#x3C;strong></code> as well - it adds also semantic “strong” importance. Your browser doesn’t recognize a difference between those two elements, but it exists. </p>\\n<h3>Italic and Emphasized</h3>\\n<p>Usually used when quote something or putting a translate of word in a lot of articles. It makes them italic - just imagine a little kicked in the right letters. For example: </p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>Theatre - <i>teatos</i>, <i>teates</i> and <i>teatron</i>.</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can also use <code>&#x3C;em></code> as well - it adds also semantic “emphasized” importance. Your browser doesn’t recognize a difference between those two elements, but it exists. </p>\\n<h3>Small</h3>\\n<p>It makes your text smaller than normal size of used font. This element’s meaning was changed in HTML5 - it represents side-comments and small print. </p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>Normal, <small>small</small>, normal, <small>small</small>!</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Marked</h3>\\n<p>Element <code>&#x3C;mark></code> makes your text marked - in different words, it makes your text highlighted. You can use it to tell readers that is one of important things in your article. For example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>HTML is full of things and <mark>it's our journey</mark> to get known them better!</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Deleted</h3>\\n<p>The element <code>&#x3C;del></code> makes your text striked in the center.
