The actual methods used in QA processes vary hugely depending on the size and nature of the product. </p>\n<p>For a personal project you will probably just test as you go, asking others to provide feedback at appropriate stages. By contrast, a banking application must have every aspect of every feature exhaustively checked and documented to ensure it is both functional and safe. </p>\n<p>Regardless of how formal or detailed a QA process is, its aim is to identify bugs so they can be resolved before the product is released.</p>\n<h3>Agile</h3>\n<p>In an Agile approach to development, the aim is that each cycle of work (‘sprint’) produces working software that can be added to and improved upon iteratively. This makes QA processes an intrinsic part of the development cycle. By testing software components at each stage of their production you reduce the risk of bugs being present at release.</p>\n<h3>Terminology</h3>\n<h4>White Box</h4>\n<p>Refers to tests performed at a structural level, within the codebase. Programmers checking that the inputs to and outputs from specific functions or components would be white box testing.</p>\n<p>Also known as ‘Glass Box’, ‘Clear Box’, ‘Transparent Box’ because the tester can ‘see inside’ the system under test.</p>\n<p>Main categories are </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> (individual units of code do what they should)</li>\n<li><strong>Integration tests</strong> (units/components interact with each other properly)</li>\n<li><strong>Regression tests</strong> (re-applying tests at later stages of development to ensure they still work)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Black Box</h4>\n<p>These test do not look inside the system under test, but treat it as ‘closed’ in the same way that the end user will experience it. Black Box testing is useful if the tested system’s internal structure can’t be observed by the tester. Black box testing focuses on higher level testing of the system and it is mainly used by independent software testers or tester teams rather than developers. </p>\n<p>There are three main techniques:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Equivalence partitioning</strong> (the tested input values are representative of larger input datasets)</li>\n<li><strong>Boundary Value Analysis</strong> (the system is tested with chosen inputs where behaviour and therefore output should change)</li>\n<li><strong>Cause-Effect Graphing</strong> (tests are designed from a visualization of the input-output relations)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Resources</h3>\n<p><a href='https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/test-driven-development' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Test Driven Development (freeCodeCamp Guide)</a></p>\n<p><a href='https://guide.freecodecamp.org/software-engineering/unit-tests/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Unit tests (freeCodeCamp Guide)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/\">Software Testing Fundamentals</a></p>",fields:{slug:"/software-engineering/quality-assurance/"},frontmatter:{title:"Quality Assurance"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/software-engineering/quality-assurance/"}}}});
