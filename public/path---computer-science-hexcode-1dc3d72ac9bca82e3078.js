Hexadecimal code is also known as Base Sixteen, where similarly, Binary code is Base Two. It is named this way because 16 unique symbols can be used as values.  In this case, the numbers 0 to 9 and letters a to f are used.</p>\n<p>Hex colors are expressed in this format: #000000, which would be the color black in this instance. Six characters are used in each hex color, using any of the 16 characters mentioned previously. These six characters are divided into three pairs of two.</p>\n<p>These three pairs each express a value for the amount of red, green and blue in a particular color. Taking the hexcode color #AA11BB, AA is the amount of red, 11 the amount of green, and BB the amount of blue. 0 is the lowest value of a color while f is the highest value.</p>\n<p>Hex codes are case insensitive, meaning that #FFFFFF and #ffffff would be the same color: white.</p>\n<p>You may be most familiar with Hexadecimal code when using it for specifying color in your CSS files. There are 16,777,216 possible color combinations using hexcode.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">Wikipedia article about Hexadecimal code</a></p>\n<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">More information on colors in CSS</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/">Explore different Hex colors</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/computer-science/hexcode/"},frontmatter:{title:"Hexcode"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/computer-science/hexcode/"}}}});
