In\norder to efficiently talk about a sequence, we use a formula that builds the sequence when a list of indices are put in. Typically, these formulas are given one-letter names, followed by a parameter in parentheses, and the expression that builds the sequence on the right hand side.</p>\n<p><code>a(n) = n + 1</code></p>\n<p>Above is an example of a formula for an arithmetic sequence. </p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sequence</th>\n<th>Formula</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1, 2, 3, 4, …</td>\n<td>a(n) = n + 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3, 8, 13, 18, …</td>\n<td>b(n) = 5n - 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>A Recursive Formula</h3>\n<p>Note: Mathematicians start counting at 1, so by convention, <code>n=1</code> is the first term. So we must define what the first term is. Then we have\nto figure out and include the common difference.
