The way that they are set up means that, on average, each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.</p>\n<p>Let us define a BST node having some data, referencing to its left and right child nodes.</p>\n<p>struct node {\nint data;<br>\nstruct node *leftChild;\nstruct node *rightChild;\n};</p>\n<h2>Search Operation</h2>\n<p>Whenever an element is to be searched, start searching from the root node.
