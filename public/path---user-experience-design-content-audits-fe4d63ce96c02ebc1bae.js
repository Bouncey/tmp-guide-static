A content audit is an activity of checking all of the content on a website(Copy, Images, video, and any other type of content) and compiling it into a big list or file. There are three main types of audits you can perform:</p>\n<p>-Full content inventory: A complete compilation of every content on the site. This may include all urls as well as all assets (such as downloadable files and videos).</br>\n-Partial content inventory: A listing of a subset of the site’s content. A partial inventory may include, for example, the top few levels of a hierarchical site or the past six months of articles. All sections of the site will be covered.</br>\n-Content sample: A less detailed collection of example content from the site.</p>\n<p>The content audit type will depend on the nature of the request, mostly for website redesign its required to do a full content inventory, for project maintenance, it’s a partial one!</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p>Ux mastery has a great guide on content audits <a href="https://uxmastery.com/how-to-conduct-a-content-audit/">https://uxmastery.com/how-to-conduct-a-content-audit/</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/user-experience-design/content-audits/"},frontmatter:{title:"Content Audits"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/user-experience-design/content-audits/"}}}});
