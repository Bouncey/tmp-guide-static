Developers or designers typically use Photoshop to create or modify assets and photographs for websites.  Some developers also use photoshop for website designs and mockups, but other tools such as Adobe Experience Design and Sketch are becoming more commonly used.  Adobe Photoshop is available for both Windows and Mac, but currently not Linux.</p>\\n<p>A common thing a developer could do in photoshop, is modify the pixel size and resolution (72dpi for web) of an image for proper web use and modify images to have transparent backgrounds (using filetypes .gif, and .png). It is a common practice to reduce the size of an image to be the largest that it will need to be used for on a website.  This reduces server space and loading times and Photoshop is a tool to achieve this.  </p>\\n<h3>Summary</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Raster based image editing software</li>\\n<li>A Photoshop file is a .psd, can export to most image filetypes.</li>\\n<li>Photoshop uses pixels.

Vector graphics are able to be resized into any shape without any pixelation.</p>\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cecyc/textures/master/vector-vs-raster.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"vector vs raster example\\\"></p>\\n<p>A photograph is a raster image, an illustration is a vector image.</p>\\n<p>Choose Photoshop when you need to work with a combination of media formats (photographs, text), or when you do not care about resizing without pixelation.</p>\\n<h3>Installation</h3>\\n<p>Adobe Photoshop is part of the Creative Cloud suite of programs. You can install a free, 7-day trial of Photoshop <a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/free-trial-download.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>via the Adobe website</a>. After the trial, you will need to select a price option that works for you.</p>\\n<p>If all you need is Photoshop, you can choose the Single Application option, which is $19.99/month, and it includes access to TypeKit (a good source for fonts) and 20GB of storage.</p>\\n<p>Students and teachers can get an <a href='http://www.adobe-students.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>educational discount here</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Basics</h3>\\n<h4>Starting a new document</h4>\\n<p>When you first open Photoshop, you will likely see a dialog box that will ask if you want to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Open an existing document</li>\\n<li>Create a new document</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you do not see this, you can go to <code>File</code> > <code>New...</code> or use the <code>CMD</code> / <code>ctrl</code> + <code>N</code>keyboard shortcut.</p>\\n<p>For web projects, you will want to choose a lower resolution or dpi (dots per pixel). The standard is 72 dpi.</p>\\n<p>For print projects, you should choose a higher resolution. At least 300 dpi is recommended.</p>\\n<h4>Overview</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cecyc/textures/master/photoshop-view.png\\\" alt=\\\"Photoshop window view\\\"></p>\\n<p>When you open Photoshop, you will see a couple major components.</p>\\n<p>The tools palette on the left and the palette section on the right.</p>\\n<p>The tools palette has all of the tools you need to manipulate or edit an image (see Tools section below).</p>\\n<p>Some tools have a palette of their own, which you will see on the palettes section on the right. You can control which palettes you see on your palette view by going to <code>Window</code> and toggling the various palettes available. </p>\\n<p>The canvas is the workspace for your project. You can move elements around the canvas, and resize the canvas. Anything not on the canvas will not be viewable.</p>\\n<h4>Tools</h4>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cecyc/textures/master/tools-palette.png\\\" alt=\\\"Photoshop Tools palette\\\"></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>Move tool: move elements around the canvas.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Selection tool: choose from a rectangular or circular selection.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Lasso tool: free-form selection tool you can use to draw a selection area.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Magic wand tool: make a selection from a specific color in an image.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Crop tool: crop the size of your canvas.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Eye dropper tool: select a color from an image and load it into you color palette.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Spot healing brush tool: clone an area from an image, and blend it into a different part of the image.

Use it to correct mistakes.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Eraser tool: free-form erasing.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Paint bucket tool: fill a selection with color (default foreground color).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Blur tool: free-form blurring of an image.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Dodge tool: lighten a section of an image.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Pen tool: use to draw a path or make a selection with finer precision.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Horizontal type tool: type text on a horizontal line (default foreground color).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Path selection tool: select a drawn path.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Custom shape tool: select from a variety of shape presets to draw onto the canvas.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Hand tool: move around the canvas.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Magnifying glass tool: Zoom in or out of the canvas.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>At the very bottom, you can set the foreground and background colors. You can quickly toggle foreground and background colors by pressing the <code>x</code> key.</p>\\n<h4>Layers</h4>\\n<p>The layers palette is accessible from the right side of the window on the palettes section.</p>\\n<p>A project is made up of multiple layers. Each element on the project is its own layer. Layers are stackable.</p>\\n<p>In the example below, the “circle” layer is on top of the “A” layer on the layers palette.
