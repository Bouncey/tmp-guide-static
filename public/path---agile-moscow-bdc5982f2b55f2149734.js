You can prioritize the requirements of a product by assigning each proposed feature to one of these categories.</p>\n<p>When a new project is conceived, all possibilities are open. It is almost inevitable that the people involved in designing it will come up with more ideas than can realistically be included (in the first version at least). Or, where there are several stakeholders in a project, each will probably have a different set of priorities and desires.</p>\n<p>Before production begins, the long-list of requirements  must be narrowed down to something deliverable. Using the MoSCoW method we can classify each requirement as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Must Have</strong> - core features without which the project cannot be said to have succeeded.</li>\n<li><strong>Should Have</strong> - important and expected, but are not quite so definitive of the product as Must Haves</li>\n<li><strong>Could Have</strong> - desirable, but not essential. Can be included if time and resource permits.</li>\n<li><strong>Won’t Have</strong> - outside the scope of delivery for the current project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By prioritizing in this way, a common definition of the project can be reached and stakeholders’ expectations set accordingly.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">Wikipedia</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/agile/moscow/"},frontmatter:{title:"Moscow"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/moscow/"}}}});
