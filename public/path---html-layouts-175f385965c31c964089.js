But as the layout gets complicated HTML tables quickly lose their ease, because of the increase in markup text.</p>\n<!-- Examples needed  -->\n<h4>CSS Float</h4>\n<p>If you are to design a 2-column based page with left navigation pane and center content viewing area, its easy to do it with CSS floats. Simply set the left navigation page into a <code>&#x3C;div></code> with style property <code>float: left;</code>. And voila you get that design. But what if you had 4 columns in a single section.
