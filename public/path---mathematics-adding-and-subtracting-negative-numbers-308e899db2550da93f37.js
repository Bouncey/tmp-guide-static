Let’s look at a real world example to get a better idea. Suppose we have a basket with some balloons tied to it pushing it upward and some weights tied to it pushing it down. Think of the force pulling the balloon up as a positive number and the force pulling it down as a negative number. If we add more weights, it’s like we’re adding a negative number and the basket gets pulled down. If we remove weights, we are subtracting a negative number and the basket gets pulled up.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<p>(-1) + 3 = 2</p>\n<p>(-3) + (-3) = -6</p>\n<p>(-2) - 4 = -6</p>\n<p>(-10) + 2 = -8</p>\n<p>20 + (-44) = -24</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/adding-and-subtracting-negative-numbers/"},frontmatter:{title:"Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/adding-and-subtracting-negative-numbers/"}}}});
