Prominent examples include Google and Facebook.</p>\n<p>It may be something as simple as the implementation of one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) in the form of some libraries to interface to a particular programming language or to include sophisticated hardware that can communicate with a particular embedded system. </p>\n<p>Common tools include debugging facilities and other utilities, often presented in an integrated development environment (IDE). SDKs also frequently include sample code and supporting technical notes or other supporting documentation to help clarify points made by the primary reference material.</p>",fields:{slug:"/computer-science/what-is-an-sdk/"},frontmatter:{title:"What is an SDK"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/computer-science/what-is-an-sdk/"}}}});
