Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers or like in the example using Javascript, a reference to the next node.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand Linked Lists, it helps to understand <strong>Arrays</strong>.</p>\n<p>To recap, an array is traditionally a <strong>static</strong> <strong>linear</strong> data structure that supports constant time random access. Insertions and Deletions are not always constant time.</p>\n<p>Advantages over arrays</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamic size</li>\n<li>Ease of insertion/deletion</li>\n</ol>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>static = size fixed at creation time\nlinear = stored linearly in memory as a single block</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>Arrays have the following disadvantages:-</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Arrays are static structures and therefore cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the data set. </li>\n<li>Arrays are also expensive to maintain new insertions and deletions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Linked Lists address some of the limitations of arrays. Unlike an array, where all the elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory, in a linked list each element is a separate object and has a <strong>link</strong> to the next element in sequence. This allows a linked list to start with space for only one element, and grow to accomodate an arbitrary number of elements by allocating memory as and when needed. </p>\n<p>Deleting elements is also simply handled by manipulating links.</p>\n<p>Once you understand the Simple Linked List (which from here on will be referred as <strong>‘List’</strong>), you can move on to the Doubly Linked List.</p>\n<p>A List as illustrated below is made up of the following components:-</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>         head    \n             |\n             | \n        +---+---+     +---+---+       +----+------+\n        | 1  | o----->|  2  | o-----> |  3 |   φ  |\n        +---+---+     +---+---+       +----+------+       \n                                              |\n                                              | \n                                              tail    </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Node</th>\n<th>Significance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>HEAD</td>\n<td>Beginning of the List</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Node(s)</td>\n<td>Dynamically allocated self-referential block contain 1 Data element and a link to the next node</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TAIL</td>\n<td>End of the List</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Most common operations available on List are,  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>AddFirst - Inserts an element at the front of the List.  </li>\n<li>AddLast - Inserts an element at the tail of the List.</li>\n<li>InsertAfter - Inserts an element after an existing element in the List.</li>\n<li>InsertBefore - Inserts an element before an existing element in the List.</li>\n<li>Remove - Remove an existing element from the List.</li>\n<li>Access / Peek - Access an existing element from the List.</li>\n<li>Size / Count - Returns the number of elements currently present in the List.</li>\n<li>IsEmpty - Check whether the List is empty or not.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Applications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Base Data Structure for Vector, Array, Queue, Stack, etc  </li>\n<li>Polynomial Representation  </li>\n<li>Ring Buffer  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\'http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/\' target=\'_blank\' rel=\'nofollow\'>Introduction to Linked Lists</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists.</li>\n<li>Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>(Singly) linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as a ‘next’ field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Doubly) In a ‘doubly linked list’, each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the ‘previous’ node in the sequence. The two links may be called ‘forward(‘s’) and ‘backwards’, or ‘next’ and ‘prev’(‘previous’).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example in Javascript:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>function LinkedList () {\n\t\tthis.head = null;\n\t\tthis.tail = null;\n\t}\n\n    // Node has three properties value, next, prev\n\n\tfunction Node (value, next, prev) {\n\n\t\tthis.value = value;\n\n\t// A \'pointer\' referencing to the next Node (if present) otherwise null\n\n\t\tthis.next = next;\n\n\t// A \'pointer\' referencing the previous Node, otherwise null\n\n\t\tthis.prev = prev;\n\t}\n\n    LinkedList.prototype.addToHead = function(value) {\n\t\n\t\tlet newNode = new Node(value, this.head, null);\n\n\t\tif (this.head) this.head.prev = newNode;\n\n\t\telse this.tail = newNode;\n\n\t\tthis.head = newNode;\n\t}</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Now Execute code</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>let LL = new LinkedList();\n\n\tLL.addToHead(100);\n\n\tLL.addToHead(200);\n    \n\tconsole.log(LL);</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Representation in C:\nA linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called head.
