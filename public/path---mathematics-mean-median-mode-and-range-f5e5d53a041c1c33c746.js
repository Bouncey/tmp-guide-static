Range will give an indication of how spread out the numbers are.</p>\n<p>  To calculate the mode, look for the number that is repated the most frequently. For example, for the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7 the mode would be 7 because there are three 7s in the group, which is higher than the amount of any other number.</p>\n<p>  To calculate the median, arrange all the numbers in increasing order and cross off the highest and lowest number until there is only one or two numbers left. If there is one number left, then that number is the median. If there are two numbers, then add the two numbers and divide by 2 to get the median. For example, in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7 the median would be 5.</p>\n<p>  To calculate the mean, add all the numbers together and divide by the total amount of elements in a group.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/mean-median-mode-and-range/"},frontmatter:{title:"Mean Median Mode and Range"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/mean-median-mode-and-range/"}}}});
