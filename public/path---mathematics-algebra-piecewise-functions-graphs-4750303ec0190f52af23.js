In order to find <code>y</code>, you use <code>x</code> to look up what interval it’s in. Let’s take a look at a simple piecewise function and its graph.</p>\n<p><img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art5img1.png?raw=true" alt="Piecewise function graph example 1"></p>\n<p>You can see that when <code>x</code> is less than or equal to 1, <code>y</code> is equal to 3, and when <code>x</code> is greater than 1, <code>y</code> is equal to x. It’s almost like piecewise functions are created by combining different functions into one.</p>\n<p><img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art5img2.png?raw=true" alt="Piecewise function graph example 2"></p>\n<p>In the graph above you can see that <code>x</code> squared could be a standalone function which would be defined for all real numbers. Instead we’ve defined our piecewise function so only values of <code>x</code> that are greater than -5 and less than 5 are input in to <code>x</code> squared. Notice that this graph appears to have two “boundary lines” at <code>x = -5</code> and <code>x = 5</code>, and the first graph has one “boundary line” at <code>x = 1</code>.</p>\n<h3>Continuous/Non-continuous Piecewise Functions</h3>\n<p>How can you tell if a particular piecewise function is continuous? Let’s look at a couple examples.</p>\n<p><img src="https://github.com/codersc/freeCodeCamp-article-images/blob/master/art5img3.png?raw=true" alt="Continuous/Non continuous piecewise functions graphs examples"></p>',fields:{slug:"/mathematics/algebra/piecewise-functions-graphs/"},frontmatter:{title:"Piecewise Functions Graphs"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/algebra/piecewise-functions-graphs/"}}}});
