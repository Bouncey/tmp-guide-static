Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->\n<p>Python can be easily used for small, large, online and offline projects. The best options for utilizing Python are web development, simple scripting and data analysis. Below are a few examples of what Python will let you do:</p>\n<h5>Web Development:</h5>\n<p>You can use Python to create web applications on many levels of complexity. There are many excellent Python web frameworks including, Pyramid, Django and Flask, to name a few.</p>\n<h5>Data Analysis:</h5>\n<p>Python is the leading language of choice for many data scientists. Python has grown in popularity, within this field, due to its excellent libraries including; NumPy and Pandas and its superb libraries for data visualisation like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Pyton really made Data crunching fun with all its numerous available libraries. Ipython with JupyterLab is another form of python that makes the usage of python in the field of data science very excellent.</p>\n<h5>Automation:</h5>\n<p>Python is one of the most flexible languages when it come to automating boring or repetitive tasks. It help system administrator in carrying out their task easily by writing script which can be easily executed from the terminal. It helps in creating bot which automate some of our daily tasks.</p>\n<h5>Artificial Intelligence:</h5>\n<p>The presence of computing is Artificial Intelligence. AI has come to stay and Python is serving as a major language to boost development in the field of AI. Tensorflow is designed with Python and it is under AI.</p>\n<h4>Mobile app development</h4>\n<p>Mobile apps and games can be created with python using Kivy, Pygame and PyQt.</p>\n<h4>Security And Networking:</h4>\n<p>Python is used to build Networking tools and security-tools that are widely used.Python’s remote automation is the most secured, fast and efficient for cloud-testing of frameworks, that’s why professional developers use python for making most secured frameworks and for socket-programmings.</p>\n<h5>Machine Learning, Deep Learning</h5>\n<p>Python is one of the best languages suited for machine learning, deep learning and data analytics with stronghold in all of them.\nThere are specialized languages best suited for various role such as R and MATLAB but when it comes to overlapping fields of applications python wins hands down due to its flexibility and rapid prototyping and availability of libraries.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p>Here’s a <a href='https://www.python.org/about/apps/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>link</a> to appications of Python on it’s offical website.</p>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<h4>Python is generally used for</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Web &#x26; Internet Development</li>\n<li>Educational Advancment</li>\n<li>Scientific Studies/Computing</li>\n<li>Desktop development</li>\n<li>Numeric Computing</li>\n<li>Software development</li>\n<li>Business Application development</li>\n<li>Machine Learning</li>\n<li>IOT</li>\n<li>Game Development</li>\n<li>Rapid Prototyping</li>\n<li>Browser Automation</li>\n<li>Data analysis</li>\n<li>Image Processing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Some article covering the usability of python</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='http://www.dummies.com/programming/python/10-major-uses-of-python/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>10 MAJOR USES OF PYTHON</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.python.org/about/apps/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Applications for Python</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3043085/where-is-python-language-used' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Where is python Language used</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1909512/what-is-python-used-for' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>What is python used for</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The offcial package index for python is <a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a></p>",fields:{slug:"/python/what-is-python-used-for/"},frontmatter:{title:"What Is Python Used for"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/python/what-is-python-used-for/"}}}});
