[…] Now, a bigger gathering of organizational anarchists would be hard to find, so what emerged from this meeting was symbolic—a Manifesto for Agile Software Development—signed by all participants. (1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Manifesto for agile software development</h3>\n<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. </p>\n<p>Through this work, we have come to value</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals and interactions over process and tools.</li>\n<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>\n<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>\n<li>Responding change over following a plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>\n<h3>Twelve Principles of Agile Software</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>\n<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</li>\n<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>\n<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>\n<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>\n<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>\n<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>\n<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>\n<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>\n<li>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</li>\n<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>\n<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html">(1) History: The Agile Manifesto</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a></li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/agile/the-agile-manifesto/"},frontmatter:{title:"The Manifesto"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/the-agile-manifesto/"}}}});
