To squash the last <em>n</em> commits into one, run the following command:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>git rebase -i HEAD~n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That will open up a text-editor with something similar to the following:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>pick commit_1\npick commit_2\npick commit_3\n...\npick commit_n\n# Bunch of comments</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Leave the first commit alone, and change the rest of the <code>pick</code>s to <code>squash</code>. Save and exit the editor.</p>\n<p>So if you wanted to squash the last three commits, you’ll first run <code>git rebase -i HEAD~3</code> and then you’ll want to edit your commits to look something like this:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>pick dd661ba Commit 1\nsquash 71f5fee Commit 2\nsquash f4b4bf1 Commit 3</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you’ve already pushed to a remote before squashing your commits, you’ll have to push to the remote again, with the <code>-f</code> flag, otherwise git will throw an error at you.</p>\n<p>It is strongly suggested that you read the information in the opened file as there are many things you can do.</p>',fields:{slug:"/miscellaneous/how-to-squash-multiple-commits-into-one-with-git/"},frontmatter:{title:"How to Squash Multiple Commits into One with Git"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/miscellaneous/how-to-squash-multiple-commits-into-one-with-git/"}}}});
