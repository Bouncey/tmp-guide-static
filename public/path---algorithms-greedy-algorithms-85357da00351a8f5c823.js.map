Some instances of the problem are as follows :</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>You are given a set of N schedules of lectures for a single day at a university. The schedule for a specific lecture is of the form (s<em>time, f</em>time) where s<em>time represents the start time for that lecture and similarly the f</em>time represents the finishing time. Given a list of N lecture schedules, we need to select maximum set of lectures to be held out during the day such that <strong>none of the lectures overlap with one another i.e. if lecture Li and Lj are included in our selection then the start time of j >= finish time of i or vice versa</strong>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Your friend is working as a camp counselor, and he is in charge of organizing activities for a set of campers. One of his plans is the following mini-triathlon exercise: each contestant must swim 20 laps of a pool, then bike 10 miles, then run 3 miles.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The plan is to send the contestants out in a staggered fashion, via the following rule: the contestants must use the pool one at a time. In other words, first one contestant swims the 20 laps, gets out, and starts biking.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>As soon as this first person is out of the pool, a second contestant begins swimming the 20 laps; as soon as he or she is out and starts biking, a third contestant begins swimming,and so on.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Each contestant has a projected swimming time, a projected biking time, and a projected running time. Your friend wants to decide on a schedulefor the triathlon: an order in which to sequence the starts of the contestants.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Let’s say that the completion timeof a schedule is the earliest time at which all contestants will be finished with all three legs of the triathlon, assuming the time projections are accurate. What is the best order for sending people out, if one wants the whole competition to be over as soon as possible? More precisely, give an efficient algorithm that produces a schedule whose completion time is as small as possible</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Lecture Scheduling Problem</h3>\\n<p>Let’s look at the various approaches for solving this problem.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Earliest Start Time First</strong> i.e. select the interval that has the earliest start time. Take a look at the following example that breaks this solution. This solution failed because there could be an interval that starts very early but that is very long. This means the next strategy that we could try would be where we look at smaller intervals first.\\n<img src=\\\"https://algorithmsandme.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/f268b-jobs.png?w=840\\\" alt=\\\"Earliest Starting Time First\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Smallest Interval First</strong> i.e. you end up selecting the lectures in order of their overall interval which is nothing but their <code>finish time - start time</code>. Again, this solution is not correct. Look at the following case.\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bz2N.png\\\" alt=\\\"Shortest Interval First\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>You can clearly see that the shortest interval lecture is the one in the middle, but that is not the optimal solution here. Let’s look at yet another solution for this problem deriving insights from this solution.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li><strong>Least Conflicting Interval First</strong> i.e. you should look at intevals that cause the least number of conflicts. Yet again we have an example where this approach fails to find an optimal solution.\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5LZ9V.png\\\" alt=\\\"Least Conflicting Interval First\\\"></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The diagram shows us that the least confliciting interval is the one in the middle with just 2 conflicts. After that we can only pick the two intervals at the very ends with conflicts 3 each. But the optimal solution is to pick the 4 intervals on the topmost level.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\\n<li><strong>Earliest Finishing time first</strong>. This is the approach that always gives us the most optimal solution to this problem. We derived a lot of insights from previous approaches and finally came upon this approach. We sort the intervals according to increasing order of their finishing times and then we start selecting intervals from the very beginning. Look at the following pseudo code for more clarity.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>function interval_scheduling_problem(requests)\\n    schedule \\\\gets \\\\{\\\\}\\n    while requests is not yet empty\\n        choose a request i_r \\\\in requests that has the lowest finishing time\\n        schedule \\\\gets schedule \\\\cup \\\\{i_r\\\\}\\n        delete all requests in requests that are not compatible with i_r\\n    end\\n    return schedule\\nend</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>When do we use Greedy Algorithms</h2>\\n<p>Greedy Algorithms can help you find solutions to a lot of seemingly tough problems. The only problem with them is that you might come up with the correct solution but you might not be able to verify if its the correct one. All the greedy problems share a common property that a local optima can eventually lead to a global minima without reconsidering the set of choices already considered.</p>\\n<p>Greedy Algorithms help us solve a lot of different kinds of problems.
