The tangent line represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that one point. The slope of the tangent line at a point on the function is equal to the derivative of the function at the same point.</p>\n<h3>Finding Equation of the tangent line:</h3>\n<p>To find the equation of tangent line to a curve at point x=x0, we need to find the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the derivative of the function (i.e.derivative of the equation of curve).</li>\n<li>Find the value of the derivative by putting x=x0 , this will be the slope of the tangent (say m).</li>\n<li>Find the value y0, by putting the value of x0 in the equation of the curve. Our tangent will pass through this point (x0,y0)</li>\n<li>Find the equation of the tangent using point-slope form. As the tangent passes through (x0,y0) and have slope m, the equation of the tangent line can be given as:\n(y-y0)=m.(x-x0)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Example : To find the equation of tangent line to the curve f(x) = 4x^2-4x+1 at x=1</h4>\n<p>Solution:\nf(x) = 4x^2-4x+1</p>\n<p>Step 1 : f’(x) = 8x-4</p>\n<p>Step 2 : m = f’(2) = 8.2-4 = 12</p>\n<p>Step 3 : y0= f(x0) = f(2) = 4.2^2-4.2+1 = 16-8+1 = 9</p>\n<p>Step 4 : m=12 ;  (x0,y0)=(2,9)</p>\n<p>Therefore, equation of tangent line is :\n(y-y0)=m.(x-x0)</p>\n<p>=> (y-9)=12(x-2)</p>\n<p>=> y=12x-15</p>",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/equation-of-tangent-line/"},frontmatter:{title:"Equation of Tangent Line"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/equation-of-tangent-line/"}}}});
