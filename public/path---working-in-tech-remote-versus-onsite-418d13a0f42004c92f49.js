When you’re onsite, you may either be in your company’s office or at a client’s office. Either way, you’re in the same physical location as the rest of the people with whom you work.</p>\n<h3>Remote Work</h3>\n<p>Remote work occurs when team members work in separate physical locations. You can work from anywhere: your home (no commute!), a co-working space (sometimes paid for by your employer), or even a beach in Thailand. Often your only restriction is that you have internet access.</p>\n<p>Because in-person communication occurs less frequently (if at all), remote teams often rely more on communication software like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>.</p>\n<p>Remote teams may host regular company retreats so team members can meet and hang out.</p>\n<h3>The “In-Between”</h3>\n<p>Some companies are 100% onsite, and some are 100% remote. But, it’s not unusual to find companies or teams that allow you to work remotely a day or two out of the week. This allows you to experience some of the benefits of remote work, without being remote all the time.</p>\n<p>Remote work can be a great tool for a business as a contingency plan in the event of inclement weather or a natural disaster.</p>\n<p>Some companies also have a physical office where you can go to work if you’d like, but allow you to work wherever.</p>\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\n<p>Quincy Larson on The Economics of Working Remotely: <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-economics-of-working-remotely-28d4173e16e2">Medium</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/working-in-tech/remote-versus-onsite/"},frontmatter:{title:"Remote Versus Onsite"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/working-in-tech/remote-versus-onsite/"}}}});
