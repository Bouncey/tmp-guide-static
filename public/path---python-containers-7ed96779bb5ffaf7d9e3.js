Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a containerâ€™s value. In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is changed.</p>\n<p><a href='https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Python Docs - Object Values &#x26; Types</a></p>",fields:{slug:"/python/containers/"},frontmatter:{title:"Python Containers"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/python/containers/"}}}});
