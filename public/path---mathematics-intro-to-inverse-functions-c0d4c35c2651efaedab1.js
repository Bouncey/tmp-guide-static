What would be the equation of the line? As you can see in the image below, it would be y=1/3x. But why is that so? If you swap x and y with each other and solve for y, you can find that the equation would be the same. This is what would be called a inverse function.</p>\n<img src=\"http://d2r5da613aq50s.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/369430.image1.jpg\" />\n<p><a href='https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides/tree/master/src/pages/mathematics/intro-to-inverse-functions/index.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Help our community expand this article</a>.</p>\n<p><a href='https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides/blob/master/README.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>This quick style guide will help ensure your pull request gets accepted</a>.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p> “How to Graph the Inverse of a Function.” <a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-graph-the-inverse-of-a-function/\">Dummies.com</a>.</p>",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/intro-to-inverse-functions/"},frontmatter:{title:"Intro to Inverse Functions"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/intro-to-inverse-functions/"}}}});
