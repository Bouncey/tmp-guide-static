It allows you to “sniff” <a href="../../network-engineering/packets/">packets</a> being sent to and from different nodes on a network.</p>\n<h4>Why use Wireshark?</h4>\n<p>Wireshark is a powerful tool, you might use it to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn about how different protocols are used in networking</li>\n<li>Troubleshoot network problems</li>\n<li>Analyze traffic going through your network</li>\n<li>Analyze the data your software is communicating to remote servers</li>\n<li>Verify that data is being properly encrypted before being sent</li>\n<li>Development of networkcommunication protocols</li>\n<li>Check for <a href="../trojans/">Trojans</a> or other malicious software on your computer</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How do I get started?</h4>\n<p>To use Wireshark in its most basic form:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">Download</a> and install the application.</li>\n<li>Select the <code>interface</code> you would like to capture packets on, this will most likely be your ethernet or WiFi adapter.</li>\n<li>Watch the pretty stream of color coded packets and let the application capture them for as long as you want.</li>\n<li>When you have enough packets, select the stop button.</li>\n<li>Save your captured packets if you want to keep them for ongoing analysis. This is done as a <code>.pcap</code> file which is a standard format for <em>packet captures</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<img src="https://thejayhaykid.github.io/images/Wireshark.png" alt="Screenshot of Wireshark on MacOS" title="Wireshark on MacOS" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 10%">\n<h4>Analysis, Filtering and Inspection</h4>\n<p>Now you have a bunch of packets, but what does it all mean? The different colors you saw indicate different types of traffic. By default some of the colors are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Light purple - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets;</li>\n<li>Light blue - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets;</li>\n<li>Black - Errors</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: These colors can all be customized but be mindful that each packet might fit into more than one category, so you must also prioritize these rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Filtering your packets is a quick way to find what you are looking for. Simply type in the text input at the top of the window to show only packets that match your query. For example if you were <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wireshark/HTTPS">looking at HTTPS traffic</a>, enter <code>ssl</code> into the filter. This will show all packets related to HTTPS connections.</p>\n<p>Now that you have found some relevant packets, select one to view more details about it. Depending on the type of packet you inspect, this will give you lots of detailed information. Some basic details will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protocol used</li>\n<li>Source address and port</li>\n<li>Destination address and port</li>\n<li>Response times</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<p><a href="https://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark.org</a><br>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark">Wireshark - Wikipedia</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/104278/how-to-use-wireshark-to-capture-filter-and-inspect-packets/">How to Use Wireshark to Capture, Filter and Inspect Packets - How to Geek</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/security/wireshark/"},frontmatter:{title:"Wireshark"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/security/wireshark/"}}}});
