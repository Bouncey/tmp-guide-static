In a more common straightforward software development process you have only one branch with bug fixes and improvements, alongside with new features. In parallel development multiple branches can coexist.</p>\n<p>Usually parallel development contains a main, “master” branch which is the most stable and contains important fixes for existing code. From the main branch, more branches are created to add new “paths” to the existing code. These branches provide new features, but do not include fixes, applied in the mean time from the master branch. Clients know about these releases and have special equipment, or test machines to be able to test the new features. When QA tests are passed, side branch can be merged with the main branch to introduce new features to the release version.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->",fields:{slug:"/agile/parallel-development/"},frontmatter:{title:"Parallel Development"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/parallel-development/"}}}});
