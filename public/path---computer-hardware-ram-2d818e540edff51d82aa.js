It is a piece of computer hardware where the data that your computer is currently working on is stored.<br/>\nUnlike hard drives, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained in RAM is lost. New users often confuse RAM with disk drive space. See <a href='https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/memory.htm' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>memory</a> definition for a comparison between memory and storage.<br/></p>\n<h4>Types of RAM:</h4>\n<p>There are two main types of RAM: static (SRAM) and dynamic (DRAM). Static RAM is constructed using flip-flops, is very fast, but is difficult to make in large sizes. Dyanmic RAM is constructed using capacitors, is fairly fast, but needs ‘refreshed’ periodically to keep charge on the capacitors. SRAM is often used closer to the CPU due to it’s speed and space constraints whereas DRAM is used as main memory.</p>\n<p>Some examples of packaging RAM are: DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. Below is an example image of a 512 MB DIMM computer memory module, a typical piece of RAM found in desktop computers. This memory module would be installed into one of the memory slots on a motherboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kVnWQebtL._SL256_.jpg\" alt=\"RAM\"></p>\n<h4>RAM speeds:</h4>\n<p>The speed rating of your RAM module is an expression of its data transfer rate. The faster the number, the faster your computer can store and retrieve the data stored in local memory. The formula for the exact speed rating changes slightly based on the version of DDR memory your computer is using. It’s no longer simply an expression of clock speed, like a processor, but a combination of hardware factors. But in general, faster is better. Like the GPU and CPU, RAM can also be overclocked. To achieve the faster speed, a user has to enable an XMP (Intel) or AMP (AMD) profile in the BIOS.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href='http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/R/RAM.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>RAM</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory\">Static RAM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory\">Dynamic RAM</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.computermemoryupgrade.net/types-of-computer-memory-common-uses.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Types of RAM</a>.</li>\n</ul>",fields:{slug:"/computer-hardware/ram/"},frontmatter:{title:"RAM"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/computer-hardware/ram/"}}}});
