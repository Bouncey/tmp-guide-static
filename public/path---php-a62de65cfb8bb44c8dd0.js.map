For example, if you complete a form on a website and submit it, or click a link to a web page written in PHP, no actual PHP code runs on your computer. Instead, the form data or request for the web page gets sent to a web server to be processed by the PHP scripts. The web server then sends the processed HTML back to you (which is where ‘Hypertext Preprocessor’ in the name comes from), and your web browser displays the results. For this reason, you cannot see the PHP code of a website, only the resulting HTML that the PHP scripts have produced.</p>\\n<h2>Installation</h2>\\n<p>PHP can be installed with or without a web server.</p>\\n<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>\\n<p>On Debian based GNU/Linux distros, you can install by :</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token function\\\">sudo</span> apt <span class=\\\"token function\\\">install</span> php\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>After installing you can run any PHP files by simply doing this in terminal :</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>php file.php</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can also install a localhost server to run PHP websites.
